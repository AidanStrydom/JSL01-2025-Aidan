# Kanban Board

## Description
Kanban is a method for visualizing work, and limited work-in-progress. It is based on cards that move from Backlog (ToDo) to Done, via as many steps (columns on the board) as required.

## Technology
The web application starts with HTML and CSS. It has been written with plain CSS, not Tailwind. The form elements are responsive, and resize as specified.

## Key Objectives

- Implement a **favicon and page title** that match the applicationâ€™s theme for a professional look.
- Create a **Kanban board with multiple columns** (e.g., "To Do", "In Progress", "Done") that **exactly replicates** the Figma design layout.
- Ensure the **boardâ€™s layout, colours, typography, and spacing** strictly follow the Figma specifications for visual consistency.
- Develop a **fully responsive** board that adapts seamlessly to **both laptops and mobile devices**, mirroring the Figma designâ€™s responsive behavior.
- Display **tasks as individual cards** within their respective columns, ensuring their design (borders, shadows, padding) follows the Figma guidelines for clarity and appeal.
- Include **titles on all task cards** to provide clear task descriptions.
- Implement a **static side panel with** the correct **icons, text, and branding elements** as per the Figma layout for a structured and professional appearance.
